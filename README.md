- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarcosKoslinski, and I live in Curitiba, Brazil
- 👀 I’m interested in code, data and technology
- 🌱 Currently, I'm learning Python, Data Science, Java, Javascript, PHP, Front End, Mathematics among so many other things that I prefer to say that learning is a fun way to live.
- 💞️ I am looking to learn and share some of my studies. Don't expect to find entire projects, because whatever is here is a little of the time I spend sharpening the axe...
- 📫 How to find me... you'll probably find me having coffee. If you want to have a coffee with me, send an email to marcos.koslinski@hotmail.com
